# Otomee.eth

A censorship-resistant Hub for The Metaverse, a place communities can call home. Create and exchange value with 0% fees. 

## What is Otomee? 

Otomee is an open, peer-to-peer, decentralized and censorship-resistant Hub based on the Ethereum blockchain where communities can create highly customizable experiences for their members, generating utility and a greater sense of belonging. Otomee also features a built-in marketplace where communities decide the rules, with fees as low as 0%.


### A Highly customizable Presentation card:



Otomee will give communities and individuals the tools they need to express themselves through their collections, offering artists, communities and collectors full control over the look and feel of their profiles and pages so they can be used as the ultimate way of representing their whole identity in one place.

These features will remain decentralized and on-chain in the form of NFTs with gas efficiency and flexibility as top priorities. Creators will also be able to share their custom themes with the world. It will be up to them to decide how they will be distributed: be it in the form of an airdrop to their communities, a free mint or if they want to charge for them. This opens a completely new sea of possibilities for communities and creators to connect.



### Onboarding brands and communities to the Metaverse: 



It is important to create easy ways for traditional brands and communities to dip their toes into the metaverse. Otomee helps them with one-click SC deployments from a preset of the most popular NFT standards and drop strategies, with automatic integration to the Otomee ecosystem.



### A built-in, open marketplace.



Otomee aims to be the place where communities can have all they need to thrive. With a built-in, open marketplace, your community can exchange NFTs and decide whether they want to pay royalties or transact completely free. 

Otomee introduces a new user-centric model where individuals will be able to curate NFT listings from different communities and present them on their themed profile page, under the Curation tab. All sales made through the user’s Curation page will give him a % of the sale defined by him, creating new markets and opportunities for individuals to leverage the metaverse economy.



### ENS at its core.



Otomee implements Sign In with Ethereum and ENS as its authentication system, implementing resolution for ENS names and avatars, but more importantly, giving communities a subdomain of Otomee.eth for their community page, helping them avoid phishing scams. Any modifications in example.otomee.eth is much easier to spot than otomee.eth/0xabcd…. Besides, settings like community themes and royalty settings (If set) will be saved in text records of the community’s subdomain.



### Otomee uses ENS to power the platform and you can use Otomee to power your ENS experience.



ENS users will have an intuitive interface to easily customize their ENS text records and set their NFTs as ENS avatars with one click, or using non-NFT images dragging and dropping to upload them directly to IPFS. If set, these text records like description, location and social media handles will be displayed in their Otomee profile.

To leverage Otomee’s built-in, censorship-resistant marketplace, the ENS community will be able to buy and sell ENS names with ENS-specific filters and 0% fees.



### The architecture:



Otomee has been designed with decentralization as a top priority. It features a serverless architecture using technologies like the EVM, IPFS to store the Web App itself, orders, setting and themes; Orbitdb to manage the data, The Graph to index blockchain information of NFTs and SCs, and ENS to logically structure the platform. None of these services has a single point of failure and every line of code of the platform is open source, thus creating a self-sustainable marketplace that everyone can use, no one can control, anyone can verify and no one can stop.
